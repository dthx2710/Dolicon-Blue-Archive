### DoliconBA
DoliconBA is a fan-made Blue Archive Progressive Web App developed upon the JAMstack architecture using Gatsbyjs (SSG) and NetlifyCMS (HeadlessCMS), hosted on Netlify Pages. Made this as a side-project to learn the JAMstack architecture :smile:

### Dolicon
I am a gacha/waifu/hololive addict. Currently pursuing a CS degree in SG. Newbie @ webdev. I play plenty of other gacha games & make resources for them too, so you might find me familiar. Find me @ Dolicon#8638 or [/contact](https://dolicon-bluearchive.netlify.app/contact)

I'm a boring person, but feel free to say hi if you see me around. :wave:

Donations via Ko-fi will help DoliconBA's future expenditures while keeping me motivated!
