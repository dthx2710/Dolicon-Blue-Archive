# How to participate in Total War.

You need to clear stage 4-1 (Normal) first in order to unlock Total War mode.

Once you clear 4-1 and it is an active season. You will meet Rin in this interface alongside other information about that season's Total War.

1. The amount of ticket you have. The ticket will be replenished on daily reset (Every 4.00 AM JST) and it will not be carried over to the next day if you have any unused ticket, **Make sure to use 3 tickets everyday!**
2. The duration of the season. Usually the season will start right after the maintenance and last around 6 days. Please note that **season actually end at 11.59 PM instead of daily reset**. 
3. Ranking and Progression Reward. Without clicking the yellow button, the game will only show you your ranking, your bracket and your accumulated ranking point. However, By clicking the yellow button you can expand this menu for more information such as: Leaderboard, End of Season Reward and Progression Reward

With 3 information you should know about Total War out of the way, We can dive into the boss itself. There are 4 difficulty: Normal, Hard, Very Hard and Hardcore. You are required to clear the boss in the previous difficulty in order to progress into the next one. 

Once you select the difficulty, You can choose between Practice and Play. Practice will not use your entry ticket which you can keep practicing for the entire duration of the season. However, ranking point gained from this mode will not be registered for your ranking.

One unique mechanic for Total War is that you are able to use more than one team. If your first team failed at killing the boss then deploy your second team, when your second team failed you deploy your third team and so on.

For the battle itself. It depends from boss to boss. Some boss make you keep clearing trash mob from wave to wave in order to damage it, some requires a DPS race before the boss obliterate everyone, etc.

Your ranking points depend on how fast can you kill the boss. It is used by the game in two ways.

1. Your ranking: Your best one-time ranking point will be used to determine your rank and bracket. Like PvP mode, Total War also has 4 brackets which give out different reward at the end of the season.

2. Accumulated point: Every ranking points from that season combined. Your accumulated point is a milestone in that season which you can redeem for free materials, pyroxene, purple shard and more.
