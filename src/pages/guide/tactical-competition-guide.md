In tactical competition, you will have to forge your way to be the best of the best teacher ever existed and reign on the top of the crown in Kivotos.
As you already know, the way Tactical Competition gameplay works is just the same as normal deployment in general. Except in this time, you will face other teachers on all across the Kivotos which probably are better than what you are right now.

Back on CBT, you can choose your own defensive terrain so the battle will goes in your favor instead of your enemy later when they go againts you. This is not the case for now, but i can assume that they will add terrain feature later on. Since the major change of team deployment mechanism, battle deployment and positioning in tactical competition is playing a major key on winning every battle. This is due to how the gameplay mechanics work out like "Cover" status and how each student's skills work out in the field.

After my major research on Tactical Competition, i shall guide you on how to survive at least on Top 1k PvP. First,  i will tell you my 2 major keys of winning battles in Tactical Competition.

\=========================================================

### **1. Well-versed on every student**

Knowing on how each student work out in the field will give you the advantage of choosing what's the best option to fight an opponent of your choice. You don't want to spend pyroxenes just to get the sweet first time position reward.
Every students has its own unique skills which plays their important role in the battle. Lets take example from our proud mama Shun.

**Sunohara Shun**

This mama can kill almost every backline on Tactical Competition in at least a shot or two, but a simple mistake on her deployment can be serious at the end of the battle.
As you already know, her EX is capable on wiping out enemy's backline in an instant. The thing is, she prioritize the one who holds the most ATK Power. The moment you fight againts another Shun and any other backline who had a higher ATK Power than her is the moment where things can get ugly. 

Because when you dont have a backline that didnt surpassed Shun's ATK Power, that's when you know that you're done for. Moreover, Shun sometimes move herself out from the cover to seek for another cover to ensure that the enemy with highest ATK Power is in her range. This could be problem especially if you're fighting againts a massive AoE skills like Hibiki and Nonomi where you're actually already out of their range but get demolished because of her movement.

Top 1k is the hellish place for Tactical Competition because only the one striker revealed and you'll never know what every other teacher has prepared for your attack, especially when you're inside the whale bracket where everything is at maximum power. The best way to remedy this is to well-known on what's the best attack unit that currently played a major role in Tactical Competition and exactly know where they might put them in formation.

As for the student who played a major part in Tactical Competition, here's a list i already made for you to fully understand of what's the composition of Tactical Competition on attacking and defending. I have them sorted based on their actual role on the field and how often people using it on Tactical Competition

This should have give you the major view on how will the battle goes on when you engage other teacher to claim the peak of Tactical Competition.

\=========================================================

### **2. Student's Positioning**

Without doubt, this also played a major role on Tactical Competition. As i already mention before, each students has their own unique skills that can work perfectly depending on how do you position them on the battle.
One thing that you should aware when you attempt to position your student before getting into combat is "Cover" mechanics. Some of the student which has this ability will seek cover that entirely depends on the formation.
This is a bit hard to be explain, but once you get to know of it you'll grasp the basics of combat movement in Blue Archive.

Lets just say you're running this kind of formation in Tactical Competition :

![](/img/screenshot_20210519-122915.png)

Since both Tsubaki will not use the nearby cover, the coverage that is supposed to be used are empty and it can be used for any backliners. Shun will definitely seek cover before engaging into combat, but the main problem is she will prioritize any closest coverage she can get. But if you noticed on how the cover mechanic and how does Shun's skill works out. There can be 3 outcomes when the battle begins, which is:

1. Shun goes for the cover that wasnt being used by Tsubaki
2. Shun goes for the cover she supposed to used (Front Cover)
3. Shun goes for the cover on her back (Back Cover)

The whole thing is entirely depends on the enemy formation as well, because she will look over on enemy frontliner position. Most of the time, option 3 is the more likely to happen. But sometimes when the enemy front is way up to the left side of the field, Shun will move herself on the cover that Tsubaki didnt use. Providing a better range attack on enemy's backline when her EX is active.

As i already mention, Shun will always repositioning herself whenever her enemy with higher ATK Power is inside her range of fire. Lets take example from this picture.

![](/img/screenshot_20210519-123124.png)

In this battle, the enemy is also deploying their Shun way out of my Shun's range so he can maximize Shun's attack on other backline. In this case, the reason why my Shun is using the backline cover is due to enemy frontline is exist on her path.
When Shun's normal skill animation stopped and if Shun's EX is active at the same time, the RNG will begin to calculate on which cover is best for Shun to aim at the highest ATK Power student at the time and to continue engaging other backline. 

Still, the whole ordeal entirely depends on the RNG. But with a better positioning, you can have a better chance on raising ranks in Tactical Competition.

Image to show the positioning of students in the field compared to preview, offence and defence.

**Meta Formations**

As for the Meta Formation, I have 3 kinds of formation that i used to outwit the whales in PvP. Keep in mind that you can change the position yourself for better chance of winning the battle. You can also customize your own backline for yourself to further increase the chance of winning the battle.

**Sweeper Formation :**

These formations are designed to simply wipe the enemy's front and backline in no time.

![](/img/screenshot_20210519-145335.png)

Formation Type :

* Backline - Tank - Backline - Backline
* Tank - Backline - Backline - Backline
* Backline - Backline - Backline - Tank

Examples :

1. Shun - Tsubaki - Haruna - Nonomi (Backline Sweeper)
2. Shun - Tsubaki - Haruna - Iori (All-Rounder Sweeper)
3. Shun - Iori - Haruna - Tsubaki (Right-Side Sweeper)

**Delay Formation :**

These formations are designed to distract the enemy's backline in an attempt to turn the tide of battle.

![](/img/screenshot_20210519-145110.png)

Formation Type :

* Backline - Tank - Backline - Tank
* Tank - Backline - Backline - Tank
* Backline - Tank - Tank - Backline

Examples :

1. Shun - Tsubaki - Haruna - Hoshino
2. Shun - Tsubaki - Hoshino - Nonomi (Backline Sweeper)
3. Tsubaki - Iori - Haruna - Eimi (Penetration Formation Counter)

**Counter Act Formation :**

This formations are designed to specifically destroy a specific unit that can cause a ruckus on the battle.  This formation is relies on your intels againts your enemy and your best deduction on what kind of student you will deploy againts it.

![](/img/screenshot_20210519-145313.png)

Example :

1. Shun - Tsubaki - Haruna - Arisu / Izuna (Tsubaki - Sumire Counter)

As for the specials, i think i can leave it to you guys. Since it was pretty much depends on you.

\=========================================================

There's yet another factor such as Skill Levels and RNG. But since it was quite self-explanatory, i will let you guys handle it for yourself.

I will keep the guides updated through the time. I hope this can help you gaining more ranks in Blue Archive's pvp. Feel free to contact me on discord (NeptuniaMX#9009) if you have questions about this. Thanks to all my comrades of the cavemens and research team who made this possible.

That's the info for now, i'll see you on another guide.
