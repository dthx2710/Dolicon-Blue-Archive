# <a name="event-overview"></a>Event Overview

The basic flow of this is as goes:

* Clear Story Mode (time-walled, will unlock gradually every day)
* Clear and farm Quest Mode

  * There are 3 shop currencies and 1 lottery box currency.
  * Using specific students will net you a bonus drop rate for some event currencies.
  * Clearing a map will save your highest bonus rate for when you skip runs in the future.
  * Farm 5 for Chocolates (A), 6 for Crepes (B), 7 for Dolls (lottery)
* Buy stuff from the event shop and play the lottery box
* Wait for week 2 to unlock Challenge Mode
* Rinse and repeat, farm whatever you need. Recommended shop priority is in another section below

This event introduces several new event mechanics, including:

* Lottery box

  * Lottery currency drops on every stage (Cherino Matroyshka). Roll and reset the boxes, rinse and repeat.
  * The lottery box is more efficient than the other shops, so it's wise to get skill books, BDs, mats (OOParts) and then move on to farming Stage 7.
* Choice-based buff/debuffs

  Going through the maps, you will notice a popup with 3 different choices. You can either choose a buff effect (red) or be greedy and take a debuff for the team in exchange for some crazy drop bonus. Specific buff translations are in another section below.
* Challenge Mode

  We really don't know much about it yet, but you can bet that we'll update this page when it gets released!

## <a name="shop-a"></a>Shop A (Cherino Brand Chocolate)

![Shop A (Cherino Brand Chocolate)](/img/cherino-shop-a.webp "Shop A (Cherino Brand Chocolate)")

### Priority of purchase:

The lottery box is more efficient than the other shops, so it's wise to get BDs & skill materials (OOParts) and then move on to farming Stage 7.

BD > OOParts < Reports (Skip)

Total Currency Required:

960 (BD) + 3875 (OOParts) + 3900 (Reports) = **8735**

## <a name="shop-b"></a>Shop B (Beard Crepe)

![Shop B (Beard Crepe)](/img/cherino-shop-b.webp "Shop B (Beard Crepe)")

### Priority of purchase:

Same as Shop A, except its now skill books instead of BDs.

Skill Books > OOParts < Orbs (Skip)

Total Currency Required:

3175 (Skill Books) + 3875 (OOParts) + 1425 (Reports) = **8475**

## <a name="shop-c"></a>Shop C (Beard Medallion)

![Shop C (Beard Medallion)](/img/cherino-shop-c.webp "Shop C (Beard Medallion)")

### Priority of purchase:

WIP

Total Currency Required:

40 (Shards) + 40 (Gems) + 40 (Goddess Crystals) + 20 (Skill Book)

* 25 (Credits 1) + 30 (Credits 2) + 25 (Credits 3) = **220**

# <a name="lottery-box"></a>Lottery Box

![Cherino Matryoshka](/img/cherino-lottery.webp "Cherino Matryoshka")

1800 currency is needed for the whole lottery box to be bought out, and with max bonuses you only need 30 runs of Stage 7 which takes up 450 AP.

For 450 AP you get:

* 2 purple, 8 gold, 16 blue, 40 white reports = 22 runs of Stage 5 330AP worth
* 1885k credits = 754 currency, \~17.95 runs, \~269 AP 599 AP worth in only credits and reports, NOT COUNTING SHARDS AND OTHER MATS

The lottery box base rewards up to 6(?) resets, and it is unlimited resets afterwards, with a less rewarding pool.
