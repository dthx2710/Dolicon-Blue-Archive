# <a name="event-overview"></a>Event Overview

The basic flow of this is as goes:

* Clear Story Mode (time-walled, will unlock gradually every day)
* Clear and farm Quest Mode

  * There are 3 shop currencies and 1 lottery box currency.
  * Using specific students will net you a bonus drop rate for some event currencies.
  * Clearing a map will save your highest bonus rate for when you skip runs in the future.
* Buy stuff from the event shop and play the lottery box
* Wait for week 2 to unlock Challenge Mode
* Rinse and repeat, farm whatever you need. Recommended shop priority is in another section below

This event introduces several new event mechanics, including:

* Lottery box

  Lottery currency drops on every stage (Cherino Matroyshka). Roll and reset the boxes, rinse and repeat.
* Choice-based buff/debuffs

  Going through the maps, you will notice a popup with 3 different choices. You can either choose a buff effect (red) or be greedy and take a debuff for the team in exchange for some crazy drop bonus. Specific buff translations are in another section below.
* Challenge Mode

  We really don't know much about it yet, but you can bet that we'll update this page when it gets released!

Speedrun:

1800 currency is needed for the whole lottery box to be bought out, and with max bonuses you only need 30 runs of Stage 7 which takes up 450 AP.

For 450 AP you get:

* 2 purple, 8 gold, 16 blue, 40 white reports = 22 runs of Stage 5 330AP worth
* 1885k credits = 754 currency, \~17.95 runs, \~269 AP 599 AP worth in only credits and reports, NOT COUNTING SHARDS AND OTHER MATS

With lottery box being more efficient than the other shops, it's wise to get skill books, BDs, mats and then move on to farming Stage 7.
