Chesed doesn't have its own offensive capability. Unlike Binah's Missile Barrage or Kuro's Mario Kart. Chesed main damage and also its gimmick comes from its ability to call upon the reinforcement robot to protect itself. These robots however will initiate self-destruct sequence sometimes after being deployed and start charging toward you, dealing enormous damage. You might survive one robot or two, but not the whole wave of 10-20 robots.

While both Chesed and its add are Heavy Armor. Teacher will spend most of the time killing adds rather than damaging its core. The student with Penetration attack (Yellow attribute) will be very effective against it especially those who can dish large amount of AOE i.e. Nonomi, Midori & Momoi etc.



# The Battle

## Phase 1: Knocking on Chesed door.

First thing you notice about Chesed is that you do not get to fight him but instead you need to eliminate the security forces around it in order to get to Chesed core.

The security forces are separated in two room, each room has two waves of enemies that you need to eliminate in order to proceed. The layout and spawn pattern will be the same everytime.



> IMPORTANT: During this stage there is no checkpoint. If your team wipe during this phase you need to do it all over again with your next team. If you don't have enough Penetration unit you can mix in Explosive unit to kill add during this phase.

## Phase 2: Shutting down Chesed core.

From this point onward your progress will be saved so you don't have to worry about doing the first phase again.

Chesed protect its core with the outer plate, In order to remove that you are required to kill 4 waves of adds.

There are 4 type of reinforcement Chesed randomly warp in.

Foot Soldier wave

Drone wave

Turret wave

Mecha wave
