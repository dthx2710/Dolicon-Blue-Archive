  info: >-
    Lazy girl who is the former vice president of Abydos High School and the
    chairperson of the task force.


    She has an uncle-like manner of speaking and prefers to play rather than work. Because of this, she is usually berated by the members of the committee, but once the mission begins, she fights hard on the front lines to protect the other members.
  hobbies: Napping, lazing around.
