    Member of the Remedial Class Department of Trinity Academy.

    Originally, she belonged to the Justice Realization Committee, but her grades fell and she fell into a crisis of repeating a year and was forced to transfer to the remedial class department. She thinks she is an elitist, but in reality, she is too stupid to keep up with her schoolwork. She has a hobby of collecting lewd magazines and is often embarrassed to be alone with her fantasies about even the most trivial things.
