    Head of the training club at Hyakkiyako Academy.


    She is a self-confessed sleepyhead, always taking naps during the day, so her friend Mimori effectively takes over the role of department head. Despite her lazy daytime appearance, she is secretly working to protect Hyakkiyako Academy at night.
