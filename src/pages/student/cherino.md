    Student council president of Red Winter Academy.


    Her obsession and desire for power is so strong that she somehow manages to return to the position of student council president, even though she is disqualified by the revolution every week.

    The fake moustache is a symbol of authority, and Cherino believes that authority comes from the moustache.
