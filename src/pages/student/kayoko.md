    Section Chief of Handyman 68, which belongs to Gehenna Academy.


    Unlike the other members of Handyman 68, she has no malicious intent but is misunderstood as a delinquent simply because of her naturally scary face. Kayoko herself has kept quiet about such misunderstandings, but it has made her more of a scary person.
