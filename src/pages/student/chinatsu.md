  info: >-
    Member of the Discipline Committee at Gehenna Academy and is in charge of
    health. 


    She's one of the few common sense people on the Discipline Committee that emphasizes rules, discipline, and procedures, and is in charge of acting as a brake to keep her members like Ako and Iori from running amok. At first glance, she seems cold like the other members of the board of trustees, but she is a gentle girl who is completely lost in the presence of cute animals.
