    Ruthless specialist in the Disciplinary Committee of Gehenna Academy.


    As the leader of the Disciplinary Committee, she immediately punishes students who violate the rules with overwhelming force when she finds them. She's quick-witted, good at her job, and has a good sense of combat, but she's also reckless, losing sight of her surroundings when she spots an enemy, which makes it easy for her to fall into simple pitfalls.
