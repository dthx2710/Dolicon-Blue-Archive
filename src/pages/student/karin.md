    Agent of the Millennium Academy's secret organization, C&C. 


    Her call sign is "Zero Two," and she is responsible for providing strong fire support from the rear.

    Unlike her rough appearance, she is the most cautious of the C&C personnel and struggles to stop Asuna and Akane from running amok during the mission.
