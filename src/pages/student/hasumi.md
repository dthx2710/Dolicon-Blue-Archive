    No. 2 on Trinity Academy's Justice Achievement Committee.


    She also serves as the tactical commander of the Justice Realization Committee instead of Tsurugi, the icon of madness. As a result, she appears to be a typical Trinity student, calm and intelligent, but she is also a member of the Justice Realization Committee. She is calmer than anyone else, and sometimes even acts recklessly.
