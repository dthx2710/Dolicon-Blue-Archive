    Kind girl who belongs to Trinity Comprehensive Academy and is devoted to the
    Knight Hospitaller.


    She is a good-hearted person who does volunteer work, but she is also overly concerned about her health, and the students around her often say that she is like a mother to them. Although she hates conflict, she takes a firm stand against enemies who threaten the peace.
