  info: >-
    She belongs to the Hyakkiyako Union Academy, and is a naturally
    radio-friendly girl in the Yin-Yang Club.


    She joined the Yin-Yang Club because she likes traditional culture like haiku. She has a mysterious atmosphere that exudes from her appearance and gestures, which makes her the target of envy among the students of Hyakkiyako, but she is hardly aware of it.
