    Member of the school lunch club that manages the cafeteria at Gehenna
    School. 


    She is an unusually kind and diligent student at Gehenna, and every morning she prepares and distributes food for hundreds of people at the school. Her cooking skills are on the good side, but due to a lack of staff in the cafeteria, she doesn't get enough credit for her skills. However, she's not giving up and is persevering in her efforts to make the menu even better.
