    Genius inventor at Shanhaijing High School.


    She is a genius, having already earned six degrees in elementary school, but rather than being a genius, she is known as a troublemaker who bullies and causes problems for others. Saya has been good friends with Nezusuke, the mouse she always carries with her, since they were children, and he is like family to her.
