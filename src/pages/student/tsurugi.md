    Chairman of the Justice Realization Committee and the official strategic
    weapon of Trinity Academy.


    She is belligerent and violent, and when she finds something she doesn't like, she destroys it before thinking about it. Thanks to Hasumi, the vice-chairperson, the Justice Realization Committee is barely under control. Tsurugi is an uncontrollable mad dog, but in front of her teacher, she shows a girlish side that can't hide her embarrassment.
