    Hacker for Veritas, the Millennium Academy's hacker group. 


    She is a skilled eavesdropper and likes to eavesdrop on the secret conversations of others. She is not very good at interpersonal relationships, and she is so bad at people that she tends to use honorifics even with first-year students. In reality, she is shy and has few words, but she becomes a person who speaks surprisingly well on the Internet.
  hobbies: Wireless communication, wiretapping
