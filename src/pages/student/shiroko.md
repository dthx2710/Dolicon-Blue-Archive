  info: >-
    Sports-loving behavioral team leader on the task force at Abydos High
    School.


    Basically, she doesn't say much, and her facial expressions rarely change, giving her a cold impression, but in fact, she is a girl who cares more about Abydos High School than anyone else.

    She does not hesitate to use any means and methods to help the school recover and sometimes proposes crazy ideas.
