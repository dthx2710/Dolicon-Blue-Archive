    Head of Gehenna Academy's Disciplinary Committee.


    She is usually a lazy person who finds everything troublesome, but when it comes to school rules, she shows her stern head of the disciplinary committee. She always says, "It's too much trouble," but on the battlefield, she makes quick decisions and acts without hesitation. Therefore, organizations hostile to Gehenna are most afraid of her appearance.
