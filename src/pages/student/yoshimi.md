    Member of the After School Sweets club at Trinity Comprehensive Academy.


    A small animal-like girl with a complex about her height and shape, who is always intimidated. She always wants to be more mature, but because her face shows exactly what she is thinking, people around her are always trying to be cute. She enjoys visiting cafes and smiles brighter than anyone else when she tastes the limited edition sweets.
  hobbies: Event-based, limited edition sweets tour
