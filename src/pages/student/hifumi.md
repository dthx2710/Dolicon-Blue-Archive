  info: >-
    Emotional and sensitive girl in the supplementary lesson department of
    Trinity Academy.


    Her appearance and grades are average, but she is popular thanks to her gentle, not sharp, personality. She listens to the worries and stories of the people around her, but because of this, she sometimes unintentionally gets carried away by the atmosphere and causes trouble.
  hobbies: Collecting Peroro goods, cute things, shopping, and consulting.
