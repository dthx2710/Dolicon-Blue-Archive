### Christmas Blog thingy (22 Dec Update)
First of all, welcome all new players from BA EN release. Time flies, it's been almost a year since BA JP released, and more than half a year since I've quitted. Been busy with life, mostly school (CS degree). Hope anyone that's reading this is doing fine too.

Straight to the topic: Some of ya'll might've noticed that I tried adding some (non-intrusive) ads on the footer of the site. There are several good reasons why I did so. On the release of BA EN + KR, there has been a gigantic influx of visitors (2-3x more than when JP was released alone), even though the site has been inactive/outdated for months. I was surprised when I received an email from netlify saying the bandwidth for this month has almost exceeded the limit, and I had to pay $20 if it did. Small background, netlify gives us 100GB of bandwidth every monthly cycle, which we had to upgrade to 200 for $19 monthly during DoliconBA's first month due to my lack of optimization of images, but this case is different.

I found it weird since I didn't expect anyone to be using DoliconBA anymore (rip), so I checked with Google Analytics to find out what's going on, and noticed that most of my users (30-40%) were coming from Korea, apparently they shared the site around for /maps function, which I thought was pretty cool (but painful for bandwidth due to the number of huge images).

When I stopped DoliconBA, I wanted it to be around on the web to be accessible whenever a rare need occurs, even when no one uses it anymore. However, as a poor university student in an expensive country, I did not want to risk pulling money out of my pocket for a game I didn't play anymore / project I didn't work on anymore, so I decided to add ads to gather some contingency fund in case we exceed the limit.

That's all for the ads justification.

DoliconBA won't be making a return, but if anyone has any requests for tiny section updates (like new campaign maps/equips) and could provide me the resources to add it in, I will gladly do so, as resource gathering/vetting is the most tedious part. Also, if anyone would like to take over the project, feel free to do so!

Finally, I would like to wish everyone (the 2-3 people who are reading this) a happy holidays, and thanks for staying around! thank you thank you~ :)

### Project Discontinued (1 June Update)
Hey guys, it's Dolicon here. As you all know, DoliconBA has been discontinued since 1 June 2021. Reasons are mainly due to me losing motivation in Blue Archive as a mobage (getting burnt out) and my other commitments.

There were also many negative feedback & hurtful comments regarding the site which I've seen over in 4chan and facebook about the usefulness and relevance of DoliconBA which definitely negatively impacted my love for the community; but I will not go in-depth regarding this topic as it is another can of worms.

My contingency plans for my main reasons was to create a team to lessen the sole dependency of any new updates on me, but it hasn't worked out thus far due to the differing commitment level of the members. Furthermore, I felt that it isn't fair to pass on the responsibility onto someone if they do not want to, or are not prepared to shoulder it; so I felt it was suitable to close down the entire project.

Thank you everyone for using the site since day 1 of BA's release, and I hope the tools in DoliconBA has served useful in at least one instance in your Blue Archive adventure! Hope yo see you guys in the future, maybe when BA eng comes out (rip nexon) or in another gacha game (probably only in waafuri en / pgr en)

PS: If anyone would like to inherit/revive this project or need any help with it, always feel free to contact me on discord :D
